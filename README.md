# ReSurf
This script generates a Resfile to be used to mutate a desgined protein's surface back to the original RCSB structure's surface.



## DESCRIPTION:
This script does the following:

1. Prints out the contents of a Resfile and saves it to mutate a desgined protein's surface back to the original RCSB structure's surface.

This script was written using Python 3 to run on GNU/Linux, it was not tested in Windows or MacOS.
This script will mostly be useful to resurface proteins after a Rosetta FFL (Fold From Loop) computation using the relax_design.xml rosetta script (not found in the rosetta suit).
Contact the author at sari.sabban@gmail.com for any questions regarding this script.



## HOW TO USE:
To use follow these steps:

1. Install biopython by running the following command in terminal (python3 -m pip install biopython) you need pip to be installed, if you do not have it you can install it in linux by running the following command in terminal (sudo apt-get install python3-pip).
2. Install DSSP in linux by running the following command in terminal (sudo apt-get install dssp).
3. Install numpy (python3 -m pip install numpy).
4. All files must be in the same directory as this script.
5. The RCSB structure should only be the needed chain, multiple chains will cause the script to fail, or give wrong results.
6. Run by navigating to working directory then typing this in the command line:
`./ReSurf.py DESIGNED_STRUCTURE.pdb RCSB_STRUCTURE.pdb > Resfile`
